# Stroke Outcomes Prediction Model

For this project, our group is using a dataset related to patient stroke outcomes to train and compare several machine learning models to predict stroke outcomes based on input variables. We will train a variety of different model types, using several different data preprocessing techniques for each one and compare the accuracy and effectiveness of each model. The best performing ones will be selected for presentation on the project's dashboard including the ability to try out the models prediction with user generated input variables, as well as a presentation of some of the findings from the dataset in regards to stroke outcomes broken down by data categories.

The dataset contains a combination of medical data and non-medical lifestyle data. We intend to create a predictive model using the entire dataset, but also compare and contrast predictions when using only medical data, or only non-medical data, as well and identifying which data categories seem to be predictive that we would not have expected.

Of course, this model is not intended for any medical use, but merely high level analysis of the limited data we have available, to find if there are any interesting correlations for stroke outcomes within the data categories of this set.
